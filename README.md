## My process

First i create a div container with a child div of text and images and center it and i divided it in half using `display:flex;` property.
then i apply the background color and card color and i add the custom font with a `@font-face` property.
i start adjusting the position of the elements 


Next, for the mobile view i see that the image is sitting right side of the card so i use `flex-direction:column-reverse` property so it will sit on top of the card
after that i start adjusting the element position to finish it off



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- pseudo selector


### What I learned

- Create Media queries
- Flexbox
- Apply a color to an image
- Add custom fonts using ```@font-face```

### Continued development

Im going to continue learn more CSS Flexbox because i found that they're very useful in some circumstances


### Useful resources

I didn't know how to make the image sit on top of the card for the Mobile screen and i found this `flex-direction` very useful https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_flex-direction.asp
